He cares about his projects, pursues understanding when the experiment does not work as expected, and has really great presentation skills.\nSummary:\nJay, was brought in as an intern to work on our teams AI projects.  AI is a broad topic, so we left most of the spaces blank on what he was to accomplish. Jay's previous code projects had a sophistication that was on/above par with his peers. With people like Jay, I find that leaving the details blank gives their professional muse what they need to go beyond! Truely, Jay exceeded what I thought possible in the short timespan he was given.\nThe details and accomplishments:\nIndustry wide, there is a large desire from companies and users to use language models to improve the user experience. Esri, sees our role as a company to empower users to do meaningful, impactful work with GIS. We know that our software is a means to important answers of which we have provided an extensive Python API. The Python API our team is focused on is Arcpy. Arcpy has over 2000+ geoprocessing tools with some tools having up to 50 arguments in the function signature. Our users will typically use our extensive code samples and edit the code to their own needs.\nJay was given many different possibilities and he chose the most ambitious; small language model for Arcpy. Small language models are less capable than large language models, so more emphasis on creating training data is needed to achieve the same outcomes in code quality. Jay has fine-tuned a LORA adapter to double our generated code quality from our current small language model. Jay achieved success was rooted in his methodical approach.\n1. Read papers on what others have done with similar data.\n2. Run the fine-tunning experiment and measure outcomes.\n3. Pursue understanding on what didn't work.\n4. Work on both long/short term project goals.\n  *This project was short, but the longer-term goal of this project was to validate the generated code to what is on the user's machine.  Jay continually worked on these priorities and managed his time efficiently.  This was vital to the success Jay had on this project.\nStruggles:\n1. Phi-4-mini-instruct is the initial model we started with.  This model's special tokens are not what is in the pytourch module. Jay continually pursued the problem with the code quality for 3-4 days before we found the truth of the issue.\n2. llama.cpp project does not have support RSLORA quantization.  Jay continued to learn what the problem was for an additional 3-4 days.\n3. Data investigations showed us that we can improve data by removing some words and making them more natural to how users work. Jay looking into these subtle nuance issues continually improved our data quality throughout his time.\nIn closing, Jay is a person worth investing your time in as it pays off in long term dividends and understanding."
